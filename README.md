# ServiceGo

ServiceGo is a Flutter application that connects customers with service
providers. It includes user authentication, provider registration, Firestore
backed data, favorites, and location features.

**Key features:**
- Customer & provider flows (registration, login, profiles)
- Search & browse service categories
- Favorites and saved providers
- Real-time persistence with Cloud Firestore
- Location-based features

**Repository layout:**
- `lib/` — Flutter app source (screens, models, providers, services)
- `android/`, `ios/`, `web/` — platform projects
- `assets/` — images & fonts
- `test/` — widget/unit tests

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK (stable channel). Recommend latest stable: run `flutter --version`
- Dart (bundled with Flutter)
- Android SDK / Xcode (for mobile builds)
- Firebase project (for auth, Firestore)

## Quick Setup

1. Install Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. From project root, fetch packages:

```
flutter pub get
```

3. This repository already includes the generated Firebase configuration file
	`lib/firebase_options.dart`. Open that file to inspect the `FirebaseOptions`
	values used by the app for each platform. You need to re-generate the file, 
    use the FlutterFire CLI to configure the
	project and regenerate `lib/firebase_options.dart`:

```
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure --project <FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID> --platforms android,ios,web
```

The CLI will create or update `lib/firebase_options.dart` and may prompt you
to download or replace platform files. If you manually replace platform files,
ensure the following are in place:
- Android: `android/app/google-services.json` (present in this repo)
- iOS: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (present in this repo)

> Note: `lib/firebase_options.dart` is the generated config used at runtime.
> If you modify your Firebase project, re-run `flutterfire configure` to keep
> the generated file in sync.

## Running the app

- Run on web (Chrome):

```
flutter run -d chrome
```

- Run on an Android emulator/device:

```
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

- Run on iOS (macOS only):

```
flutter run -d <ios-device-or-simulator>
```

## Building releases

- Android APK:

```
flutter build apk --release
```

- iOS (macOS):

```
flutter build ios --release
```

- Web:

```
flutter build web
```

## Testing

Run unit and widget tests:

```
flutter test
```

## Firebase Notes

- This project integrates Firebase services (Auth, Firestore). The repo
	already contains the platform files and the generated Dart config:
	- `android/app/google-services.json`
	- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
	- `lib/firebase_options.dart` (generated by FlutterFire CLI)
- If you fork or clone this repo for your own Firebase project, replace the
	platform files above and run `flutterfire configure` (or run the CLI with
	`--project`) to regenerate `lib/firebase_options.dart` for your Firebase
	project.

## Contributing

Thanks for your interest! To contribute:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Follow existing code patterns in `lib/`.
3. Add tests for new logic or UI.
4. Open a pull request describing your changes.

## Troubleshooting

- If `flutter run` fails on Chrome, run `flutter doctor` and verify SDKs.
- For Android build issues, ensure an Android SDK and emulator are installed.
